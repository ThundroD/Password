# Password
This is a password authenticator that asks a user to create a password. The program will ask them to type the password the first time and then ask then to type it in again to confirm.

The password is deemed unusable if it does not contain a number or the two inputs donâ€™t match.
Every password entered by the user is written to a text file.

The program prints out whether the password has been created or not. If it has not been
created, it specifies what the user needs to fix and ask the user to try again.
